# Kuempel et al. Improving the sustainability of global fisheries trade by eliminating redundant exchanges

Global seafood demand has increased rapidly over recent decades, putting pressure on fisheries to fill gaps in supply. Nations can acquire seafood to meet consumer demand by fishing their own waters, fishing outside of their waters (i.e., in the High Seas or in another nations EEZ) or through international trade. Fisheries and trade dynamics are complex, and dependent on political, economic and social factors that often change through time. However, these dynamics may give rise to inefficiencies within the system that have implications for sustainability and food security now and in the future. One major source of inefficiency may occur when countries exchange like-for-like species through trade (i.e., import/export) or fish the same species in each other’s waters. Here we quantify the amount of same species exchange in the global seafood industry. We found that X countries fish the same species in each other’s waters, and Y countries engage in same species trade globally. These sorts of exchanges account for X% of global catch and Y% of global trade.
